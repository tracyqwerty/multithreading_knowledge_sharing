# GPTpool 

## Constructor

This code is a constructor for a class called `ThreadPool`. It creates a thread pool of a specified size and initializes each thread to pull and execute tasks from a queue.

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. `ThreadPool(size_t threads) : stop(false) {...}`: This is the constructor for the ThreadPool class. It accepts one parameter, `threads`, which is the number of worker threads that the ThreadPool will manage. The `: stop(false)` part is an initializer that sets the `stop` member variable to false. `stop` is a flag used to indicate whether the thread pool should stop executing tasks.
2. `for (size_t i = 0; i < threads; ++i) {...}`: This loop creates `threads` number of worker threads.
3. `workers.emplace_back([this] {...});`: This line creates a new thread and adds it to the `workers` vector. The thread executes the function defined in the lambda expression `[this] {...}`.
4. The lambda function `[this] {...}`: This is the function that each worker thread will execute. The thread enters an infinite loop in which it continuously pulls tasks from the queue and executes them. 
5. Enters an infinite loop (`for (;;)`).
6. `std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(this->queue_mutex);`: This line locks the mutex `queue_mutex`, ensuring that only one thread can access the task queue at a time. This is necessary to prevent race conditions.
7. `this->condition.wait(lock, [this] { return this->stop || !this->tasks.empty(); });`: This line causes the thread to sleep if there are no tasks in the queue and `stop` is false. The thread will wake up when another thread adds a task to the queue or sets `stop` to true.
8. `if (this->stop && this->tasks.empty()) return;`: If `stop` is true and there are no tasks left in the queue, the thread will stop executing.
9. `task = std::move(this->tasks.front()); this->tasks.pop();`: If there is a task in the queue, the thread will move it from the queue to the `task` variable and then remove it from the queue.
10. `task();`: This line executes the task. After the task is executed, the thread will go back to the beginning of the loop and wait for the next task.

In summary, this constructor creates a number of worker threads that continuously pull tasks from a queue and execute them. When there are no tasks left, the threads sleep until new tasks are added or they are told to stop.

## Enque

This code is a method for the ThreadPool class that enqueues a task into the task queue for the worker threads to execute.

Here is a breakdown of how it works:

1. `template <class F, class... Args> auto enqueue(F&& f, Args&&... args) -> std::future<typename std::result_of<F(Args...)>::type> {...}`: This line declares a template method `enqueue` that takes a function `f` and an arbitrary number of arguments `args...`. **The `&&` is used for perfect forwarding, which means the arguments are passed on such that they retain their original lvalue/rvalue property.** The return type of `enqueue` is a `std::future` of whatever type the function `f` returns when called with arguments `args...`.

2. `using return_type = typename std::result_of<F(Args...)>::type;`: This line is defining a type alias `return_type` for the type that results from calling the function `f` with arguments `args...`.

3. The `std::make_shared<std::packaged_task<return_type()> >(std::bind(std::forward<F>(f), std::forward<Args>(args)...));` line does several things:
   - `std::bind(std::forward<F>(f), std::forward<Args>(args)...)`: This binds the function `f` with its arguments `args...` and also forwards the arguments so that they retain their original lvalue/rvalue property.
   - `std::packaged_task<return_type()>`: This wraps the bound function in a `std::packaged_task` which allows the return value of the function to be retrieved in a `std::future`.
   - `std::make_shared<...>`: This wraps the `std::packaged_task` in a `std::shared_ptr` for efficient and safe memory handling.

4. `std::future<return_type> res = task->get_future();`: This gets a `std::future` from the `std::packaged_task`. This `std::future` will hold the return value of the function when it is executed.

5. `std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(queue_mutex);`: This locks the mutex to ensure safe access to the task queue.

6. `if (stop) throw std::runtime_error("enqueue on stopped ThreadPool");`: This throws an exception if `stop` is true, because tasks should not be added to the queue if the ThreadPool has been stopped.

7. `tasks.emplace([task]() { (*task)(); });`: This adds the task to the task queue. The task is wrapped in a lambda function to ensure it can be called with no arguments, which is necessary because the worker threads call the tasks with no arguments.

8. `condition.notify_one();`: This wakes up one of the sleeping worker threads, if any are sleeping.

9. `return res;`: This returns the `std::future` that will hold the result of the task. The user of the ThreadPool can use this `std::future` to get the result of the task when it has completed.

In summary, the `enqueue` method is used to add tasks to the ThreadPool. The tasks are functions with arbitrary arguments and return types. The return value of the function is accessed through a `std::future` which is returned by `enqueue`.
